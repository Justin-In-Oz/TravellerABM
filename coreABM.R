#This is the model of the processes that are in Books 1-3 of the 
#Traveller game that came out in the late seventies. This will
#use agent based modelling to explore the survival of captains 
#and their ships from bankruptcy. Can free traders survive? If
#not, what constraints need to be relaxed for them to do so.
#this project is to learn how to design and implement an ABM 
#and to explore the solution space for free trader survival
